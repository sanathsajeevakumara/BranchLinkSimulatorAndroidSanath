# BrachLink Simulator Android Sanath

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Jetpack Compose's deep link navigation feature into an Brach IO Android application.

## Overview

The navigation in this project was initially implemented using manual navigation, where the navigation controller was used to navigate to specific screens using routes. This functionality worked as expected.

However, the goal of this project is to explore and implement deep link navigation using Jetpack Compose. Deep linking allows for navigating to specific content within an app directly from a URL or another app, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Issue

Currently, there is an issue with the deep link navigation implementation. Despite setting up the deep links correctly, the app consistently navigates to a specific screen instead of dynamically handling different deep links.

## Seeking Solutions

The main question for this project is whether there is a solution available from the Branch IO side to resolve the deep link navigation issue. Branch IO is a platform that offers solutions for deep linking and attribution.

## Instructions

To run this project and observe the deep link navigation behavior:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.
4. Try different deep links to see the navigation behavior.
