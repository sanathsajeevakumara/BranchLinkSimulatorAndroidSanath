# Project Title

This project aims to address the issue of navigating to specific Jetpack Compose screens efficiently, especially when multiple compose screens are involved.

## Overview

Initially, the app did not have several Jetpack Compose screens. However, upon introducing multiple screens and reconfiguring the app to switch between them based on deep links, we encountered navigation failures.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to devise an approach that allows seamless navigation to a specific Jetpack Compose screen, even when dealing with multiple compose screens within the app.

## Issue Description

The current app setup fails to handle deep link navigation effectively when there are several Jetpack Compose screens. Despite correct configuration, the app consistently navigates to the wrong screen, highlighting a critical issue that needs resolution.

## Seeking Solutions

We are actively seeking solutions to ensure smooth navigation between Jetpack Compose screens using deep links. Any insights or approaches to resolve this issue are highly appreciated.

## Instructions

To run this project and observe the deep link navigation behavior:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.
4. Test deep links to different screens and observe the navigation behavior.
